# Hidden Trials
> Made using libGDX (check them out <a href="https://libgdx.com">here</a>!)

A top-down adventure game.

## Requirements:
* Java 14 (should work with 8 though)
* OpenGL 2+

## Installation:
Simply clone the repository then use the `run` gradlew command. To build and export the .jar, run the `build` task and look in `desktop/build/libs` for the built .jar file.

## Notes:
* I won't be specifically porting this to iOS and Android, but feel free to do it yourself. I'll leave in incomplete support to help you out too.
* If you are good at level design, pixel art, storytelling, composing music, or something else, please tell me, because I could really use your help.
* Also, if you need help with the libGDX game engine in general, ask them first. I don't know any more than you do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* Oh yeah, and feel free to mod the game all you want. Just give the original credit, or even consider contributing!
