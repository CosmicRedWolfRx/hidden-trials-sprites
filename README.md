# Hidden Trials
> Made using libGDX (check them out <a href="https://libgdx.com">here</a>!)

A top-down adventure game.

## Requirements:
* Java 14 (should work with 8 though)
* OpenGL 2+

## Notes:
* I won't be specifically porting this to iOS and Android, but feel free to do it yourself.
* If you are good at level design, pixel art, storytelling, composing music, or something else, please tell me, because I could really use your help.
* Oh yeah, and feel free to mod the game all you want. Just give the original credit, or even consider contributing!
